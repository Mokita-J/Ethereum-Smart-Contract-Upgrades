# Ethereum-Smart-Contract-Upgrades

While smart contracts are typically considered immutable entities on the blockchain, advancements in software engineering have introduced the concept of upgradeability.
This capability proves invaluable for rectifying bugs and introducing new features post-deployment.
In an effort to shed light on the dynamic landscape of smart contract upgrades, this analysis focuses on listing proxy smart contracts that underwent upgrades on December 2nd on the Ethereum mainnet.
Leveraging event-based data collection and static code analysis, the results unveil 19 proxy contracts that underwent upgrades on that specific date.
All relevant data and source code for this research are accessible in this repository.
